# rough idea
A big ol' doc for what we are aiming for as a final project.

## graphics
- 2D
- top-down view
- grid/tile-based level design
- pixel-art (externally made assets)

## sound design
- background/ambient music
- SFX (e.g. hit sound, coin-grab sound, transition sound)

## level design
- Hand-made "milestone" levels
- procedurally-generated "filler" levels between milestone levels
